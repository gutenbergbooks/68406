</div>


<p>The medicine which forms the subject of the
following treatise has been so lately introduced
into practice, that few Physicians are acquainted
either with its properties, or with the manner of
using it. Almost all have heard of its effects in
discussing bronchocele; and some, rashly presuming
that it cannot be a drug of great power,
have prescribed it without giving themselves the
trouble of making any inquiry into the manner of
employing it, or the dangers to which its use is
liable. I have thus seen more than one Physician
seriously injured in his reputation; and
I have seen many patients irrecoverably injured
in their health by this subtle and powerful
medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>Not long since I was informed by a Physician,
of great and deserved eminence, in London, that
he had prescribed it to the extent of ten grains
at one dose to a young woman. Most fortunately
she was saved by vomiting. About a
year ago, I was consulted on account of a young
lady in the last stage of tubercular pulmonary
consumption. She was attended by a Surgeon,
who had bled her to a most unaccountable degree.
This gentleman proposed to me the use
of digitalis, which being objected to, he then
proposed successively the use of hemlock and
iodine. It was plain that he was about as well
acquainted with the virtues of one medicine as
with those of the other, and not better versed in
the history of the disease he was treating. When
a medicine of so much power is thus in the hands
of every person, I trust I shall not stand in need
of apology for having made public the following
little treatise. Its materials have been for some
time in my possession; and I was desirous of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
delaying yet a little the publication of them;
but certain statements have gone forth to the
world, of the great benefits to be derived from
the use of iodine, while the history of its dangers
has been most unaccountably withheld. It is in
order to fill up this hiatus, and at the same time
to direct particularly the attention of Practitioners
to the proper manner of using it, with
a view to its good effects, that this essay is
written.</p>

<p>Particular circumstances have afforded me
opportunities of seeing this medicine extensively
used; and at the same time of witnessing the
bad effects which resulted from the prodigal
manner in which it was first employed. I
have also made inquiries respecting its history
in countries which I have not visited. The
answers I have received have not been so detailed
and satisfactory as I could have wished:
they have all, however, more or less confirmed
the observations I have made myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
or which have been communicated to me from
different parts of Switzerland and France.</p>

<p>Some persons may, perhaps, desire to see a
daily report of the different cases to which allusion
is made in the following pages; but this would not
have been consistent with my plan, which is
rather at the present time to present an essay
than a treatise to the public.</p>

EFFECTS OF IODINE.</h2></div>


<p>The discovery of specific remedies has
always, and most justly, been considered
one of the most important benefits to be
conferred on the practice of medicine.
Much dispute has been carried on respecting
their nature, but all are agreed about
their existence. They have been defined
by Dr. Young to be medicines which cure
diseases, “without any perceptible connexion
between the immediate effect and the
benefit obtained.” While their operation
is thus obscure, the mode of their employment,
and their peculiar virtues, must be
subjects of much doubt and uncertainty;
while the accidents to which they are liable,
in common with other medicines, must occasion
great embarrassment and perplexity.
But from the moment their modus operandi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
can be connected with any known general
law of the constitution, a great part of these
doubts disappear, a light is afforded for
directing their good effects, and a clew is
obtained for tracing their injurious properties,
and applying the necessary antidote.
The medical history of iodine will
fully exemplify the above observations.</p>

<p>This medicine was first introduced into
practice by Dr. Coindet of Geneva. Whilst
making researches for other purposes, he
found that the fucus vesiculosus had been
recommended by Russel in the cure of
goitre. From this plant, and other species
of the same family, the soda, with which
iodine is generally found combined, is
extracted. As the sponge, whose virtues
have long been established by certain experience
at Geneva,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is also a maritime plant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Dr. Coindet suspected that iodine might be
the active principle of them both; and by
this analogy he was first led to employ
it in the cure of bronchocele. The success
which attended its use in the first instance
was very remarkable; and it seems to have
been exhibited cautiously and warily, for
some considerable time had elapsed before
the alarm was given of its noxious
effects.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>It may easily be imagined, with what
joy the discovery of a certain remedy for
bronchocele was received in a place where
that disease is extremely common. Many
used it, and many were delivered from their
unseemly and most inconvenient malady.
But this state of things was not of long
duration. Familiarity with the remedy
begat too great liberality in its use, the
effects of which were speedily apparent.</p>

<p>Iodine was then looked upon as a specific
remedy for goitre. Its effect upon the
system was little known and little attended
to. No person seems even to have considered
how it produced its astonishing
results. Its efficacy, however, in the cure
of goitre, was soon generally recognised.
Its reputation flew over the city and neighbourhood
of Geneva, and it was taken with
the utmost levity, with and without medical
advice. Dr. Coindet justly deplores this
abuse, which was the cause of the unmerited
discredit into which the remedy afterwards
fell. When it had been used for some time
in this manner, its pernicious effects began
to show themselves; several persons paid for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
their temerity with their lives, and many
were irreparably injured in their health.
Every day brought to light some new catastrophe,
the effect of iodine; and in the
course of a short time its name was associated
with the idea of a most intractable
and virulent poison. Neither patient nor
physician dared venture on its employment.
It seemed to be one of those benefits held
up to invite the appetite, while its use was
denied us.</p>

<p>These melancholy consequences of its
indiscriminate and lavish employment, show
that iodine is a medicine of great power,
and teach the necessity of watching and
studying its operation. Nothing can assist
us more in forming an accurate estimate
of its virtues than a careful observation
of the bad effects which flow from its abuse;
and we shall now, therefore, proceed to consider
them in detail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some time after the introduction of iodine
into practice, a few cases of severe spasmo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>dic
affection of the stomach and bowels
occurred. They were attended with violent
and incessant vomiting, excruciating pain of
stomach and bowels, strong spasms of the
back and legs. The tongue was commonly
furred, and the bowels sometimes violently
purged, at other times obstinately constipated.
The pulse was generally extremely
frequent, small and depressed—the eyes sunk
and hollow—the countenance ghastly and
pale. These accidents were usually imputed
by the patients to the iodine they
had taken. The Physicians by whose advice
the medicine had been given, would
not allow this origin of the disease, till a
repetition of similar cases determined that
the sufferers were right. The vomiting,
pain of the bowels, and the cramps of the
legs, are extremely severe. They are also
with the greatest difficulty allayed, continuing
sometimes for many days, and renewed
during weeks, and even months,
after taking food. The legs sometimes
swell in the first instance, and afterwards
become rapidly thin and meagre. There
is another symptom, which, though common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
to almost all diseases, is peculiarly the sign
of this. The emaciation which attends this
irregular action of iodine is so rapid and
so extreme as to strike terror into the
minds both of patients and physician. A
magistrate of Geneva, high in office, robust,
corpulent, and of an athletic form, was so
much reduced in flesh, that he was not
known by his oldest acquaintances. I
have seen emaciation, in one case, proceed
to such an extent in a short time as
is almost incredible. A young English
lady, at a boarding-school, at Paris, had
for some time been afflicted with goitre.
Her brother was prosecuting the study of
medicine there. With the characteristic
zeal of a young man, as soon as he heard
of the wonderful effects of iodine, he determined
on making trial of its powers on
his sister. He did not find much difficulty
in persuading her to become the subject of
his experiments, nor did he encounter more
difficulty on the part of the French gouvernante
to whose care she was confided.
The remedy succeeded, as usual, in greatly
diminishing the tumour; and for some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
no bad effects were apparent. A small
hard knot only remained in the situation
which had been occupied by a considerable
swelling before; and the desire to get rid
of this little tumour was the cause of the
remedy having been pushed too far. Its
deleterious effects first showed themselves by
gnawing pain at the upper part of the
stomach, great anxiety, and oppression.
These symptoms were disregarded, and the
remedy was persevered in for a week longer,
during which time the patient became very
much emaciated; she was frequently affected
with vomiting, the pain of the abdomen became
more frequent and more severe, and
the thirst was very distressing. I was
sent for early in the morning, in consequence
of an alarming diarrhœa, which
had come on during the night, and I found
her in a deplorable condition indeed. Her
brother, and the mistress of the boarding-school,
were so alarmed at the consequences
of their conduct, that they were
quite unfit to give any advice about her
treatment; they could hardly indeed give
me a coherent account of what had passed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and the poor young lady was therefore
entrusted to the care of servants. She
was then suffering the most excruciating
pain at stomach, violent cramps, and convulsive
action of the muscles of the arms,
back, and legs, from which she had scarcely
any intermission. The vomiting and purging
were almost incessant. The dejections
were bloody, slimy, and very scanty, but
at first had been copious and feculent. The
matter vomited was of a dark green colour,
streaked with blood. The tongue was
loaded with a thick crust, resembling in
colour the matter vomited. The countenance
was pale, contracted, and with that
peculiar expression which announces abdominal
suffering. The pulse was small,
hard, and frequent, scarcely indeed to be
numbered. The whole appearance of the
patient was such as to excite well-grounded
fears for her life. Being quite unable to
swallow, four grains of opium were directed
to be thrown into the rectum. They were
not, however, long retained, and were
not productive of benefit. An anodyne
embrocation was therefore applied to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
pit of the stomach, fomentations to the feet;
and, as soon as it could be got ready, she was
placed in a warm bath. This so much
quieted the irritation of the stomach, that
she was enabled to swallow about thirty
drops of laudanum, from which there was
a decided alleviation of her sufferings for
nearly an hour. During ten days she remained
in a very doubtful state, subject
to frequent severe attacks of diarrhœa, with
intense pain of the bowels. Her emaciation
during this time was most extraordinary.
The expression of her French nurse, “<i>décharnée</i>,”
was literally applicable to her; her
arms and body were almost fleshless—her
breasts, which had been large, were now
perfectly flat—the calves of her legs had
quite disappeared—and her thighs were
not much thicker than her wrists, when in
health. I never witnessed any thing like
such extenuation in so short a space of
time. By the steady and very liberal use
of opium, she recovered to a certain degree;
but when I last saw her, many months
after her illness, she remained subject to
frequent violent spasms of the stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
during which opium alone gave her relief.
Her nervous system had been much shattered.
She repeatedly declared to me that
she seldom enjoyed an hour’s respite from
the most wretched depression of spirits,
and since her illness had never felt any thing
like her former buoyancy of mind. The
few moments of ease she knew were purchased
by large doses of laudanum, to the
habitual use of which her sufferings had
forced her. She was still very pale, and
her emaciation, though much less, was yet
very great. She was indeed a miserable
monument of the effect of iodine. I heard
of this young lady a few weeks ago; she
was then much better, had in a great degree
recovered her looks, and was able to leave
off the use of opium almost entirely. Her
stomach, however, still remained very weak,
and obliged her to be very careful of her
diet. The bronchocele had not returned;
but the small hard swelling mentioned
above remained still very sensible to the
touch, but not evident to the eye.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are the outlines of a very severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
case. I trust that such a one is not likely
to occur soon again. But if practice so
daring as I have more than once witnessed
in London be repeated, we may very soon
see even worse accidents than the above.
These statements, however, are important,
inasmuch as they demonstrate that iodine
is not merely a medicine of specific power
against bronchocele, but that it dissipates
this disease, by virtue of its very important
action on the whole absorbent system. I
shall take further notice of this property in
a future part of my paper.</p>

<p>There is an effect of iodine to which I
have alluded in the case just quoted, but
which is so extremely common, when the
remedy has been pushed to an overdose,
that it deserves to be noticed at greater
length. The anxiety and depression of
spirits are so great and persevering as to
warrant my considering them as the peculiar
effect of iodine, and not the consequence of
the great debility which attends the violent
and inordinate action of this medicine on
the constitution. It is an affection very
different from hypochondriacal melancholy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
inasmuch as it dwells principally on the present
and has no reference to the future.
Patients have generally described it to me as
a sense of sinking and faintness, which were
peculiarly oppressive, and I have heard
them complain of it while suffering the most
intense pain, as the part of the complaint
which was yet the most difficult to bear.
This symptom is an almost constant attendant
on the violent action of iodine on the
system, and frequently makes its appearance
in a lesser degree when the medicine acts in
a kind and salutary manner.</p>

<p>We have now to notice the effect of
iodine on the nervous and muscular systems,
and this is by far the most interesting part of
our paper. It is that also on which the
greatest degree of doubt and uncertainty
rests.</p>

<p>The nervous and muscular systems are
peculiarly exposed to the irregular action of
this medicine. In certain persons, indeed,
of peculiar habits of body, it cannot be
exhibited so as to affect the constitution in
any manner, without in some shape or other
producing unpleasant nervous symptoms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
such as dimness of vision, indistinct hearing,
fallacious touch, insomnia, breathlessness,
palpitation, and all the countless forms of
inward nervous derangement. But the
symptom to which we shall more peculiarly
confine our attention, is a degree of tremor
which generally comes on when the patient
is under the full constitutional influence of
iodine. This symptom may be reckoned a
good gauge of the degree of nervous excitement
which has taken place, and it is seldom
or never absent when that excitement has
proceeded to any considerable degree. It
generally begins by a slight trembling of the
hands, resembling that which takes place
from the poison of lead; and if the medicine
be incautiously continued, the larger muscles
of the arms, legs, and back become affected.
When in this state, the patient can with
difficulty walk, and his progression is a
tottering uncertain motion. He cannot
carry any thing straight to his mouth, but
the hand moves in a zig-zag manner, and
with difficulty arrives at the mouth at last.
This complaint is generally attended with a
hurried circulation, and a small thready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
pulse. There is commonly great suffering
at stomach and confined bowels.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> When
nervous affection first appears the medicine
must be most diligently watched, and if the
symptoms seem to increase, its use should be
instantly put a stop to. If rashly persevered
in, the symptoms I have described above
will certainly be excited, and then it is vain
to withdraw the medicine; the complaint
goes on progressive for weeks and months,
even though its exciting cause be abstracted;
and when it does at last begin to diminish,
the amendment is so slow and gradual that
the patient is scarcely conscious of the relief
he receives. I saw two cases of this kind
with Dr. Peschier of Geneva, in which the
patients had suffered more than twelve
months, and yet their sufferings had undergone
little mitigation. It is of some importance
not to provoke a complaint with so
much difficulty allayed; and no one who has
not seen it can have an idea of the slow and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
imperceptible degrees by which it steals on
the patient. Its first advances generally
escape his observation as well as that of his
physician. A slight trembling of the fingers,
quivering of the eye-lids, occasional subsultus
of the tendons of the fingers, arms,
and legs, are generally the first symptoms
observed, and it behoves us to be constantly
on the watch for them. I have always
obliged my patients to raise an empty glass or
any light object to the head. By this means
the smallest degree of unsteadiness in the
hand will commonly be detected. I recommend
a light object to be used for this
purpose, because a heavy one tends to give
steadiness to the muscles and to disguise the
complaint.</p>

<p>This effect of iodine is frequently complicated
with the choleric complaint I have
already described; but it is evident that their
proximate cause is different, since they also
exist separately. The nervous affection is
most common, if I may trust my observations,
in the mobile constitutions of women; at least
nine out of ten cases, which I have seen,
were in women, and by far the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
number in young nubile girls. In the
latter cases the disease generally excites
some hysterical symptoms.</p>

<p>This affection differs from chorea. The
patient has no difficulty in keeping the
affected limbs steady, if not called upon to
exert them, and in general exertion is
irksome and painful. Like chorea, however,
it is always attended with a constipated
condition of bowels. The evacuations, also,
are uniformly hard, scybulous, and dark
coloured. There is certainly a considerable
resemblance between the two diseases, but
it would be too much to assert that what has
been called their proximate cause, or their
nature, is the same. Such an idea, however,
has been adopted by more than one physician
who has seen these cases along with myself.
I mention this, not in order to give weight
to the opinion, but in order to give my
readers a more distinct notion of the form,
which the affection we have been considering
sometimes assumes. A statement of
this kind is more graphical than many descriptions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Mr. Orfila, whose industry and ingenuity
in the study of poisons are well known, has
not neglected to examine and note the
effects of iodine when given in a large dose.
He gave it to different animals in the quantity
of a dram and two drams. They were in
general seized with violent and frequent
vomiting. When the contents of the stomach
were not soon thrown off, or were altogether
retained, the poison was much more speedily
fatal. The animals do not seem to have been
affected with any other very remarkable
symptom. It is stated that they were much
dejected, and manifested suffering, though
they did not howl, were not paralyzed or
convulsed, and were not affected with any
of the more violent symptoms by which
poisons commonly show their action on
the living body. It is plain that much
light is not thus thrown on the effects of
iodine when exhibited as a remedy; yet
when considered along with the appearances
after death, we still find a certain
analogy. The stomach was generally found
corroded by small ulcers of a linear form,
which had eaten through the mucous coat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Those parts, also, which were most exposed
to the action of the poison, were thinner and
more transparent than the others, and
were easily torn asunder. The mucous
membrane in the neighbourhood of the
pylorus was found much inflamed, swelled,
and covered with a crust of coagulated
lymph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The affection of the alimentary canal
which we have described above, is plainly
to be ascribed to the acrid operation of
iodine on its mucous membrane. I have
never witnessed it in any considerable
degree when this medicine had not been
taken internally. But I have seen slight
pains of stomach, accompanied with copious
bilious evacuations, attend its external use.
These never proceed to the degree of
violence which marks the internal exhibition.
Indeed, it is rare to see them in any
considerable degree disturb the comfort
of the patient. It is not thus when taken
into the stomach. The case of the young
lady related above, sufficiently shows its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
deleterious influence. I have never seen
any disease of the bowels which more closely
resembled the terrific descriptions given by
the physicians of India, of the sufferings
from the cholera of that country. Yet no
medicine varies more in its effects than this.
Some persons take it in large doses for a
great length of time with perfect impunity;
while others, from that peculiar, undescribed
and unintelligible state of constitution,
called by physicians an idiosyncrasy, are
speedily and violently affected by very small
doses. Mr. Magendie, whose accuracy is
well known, states that he had swallowed a
spoonful of the tincture, containing about a
scruple of iodine, without any bad effect
ensuing. A child, also, four years old,
swallowed by mistake a tea-spoonful of the
same preparation with equal impunity.
These are extraordinary instances, for I
have received the account of the death of a
fine boy ten years old, who did not survive
many hours after having swallowed the largest
of the above doses. And a strong man
who took this medicine, under my own care,
in doses of half grains three times a-day for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
one week only, was very soon affected in such
a manner, that, had the medicine not been
immediately interrupted, the most lamentable
consequences might have ensued. When
this medicine is given internally, and it is
often necessary that it should be thus
exhibited, it must be used with extreme
caution, under the sanction and observation
of those who are able to watch its effects,
and who are experienced in its virtues.</p>

<p>I have never seen a case in which the
mismanagement of iodine proved fatal, and
cannot, therefore, say whether its long
continued use ulcerates the mucous membrane
of the stomach in the human body,
after the manner described by Orfila. I
have no reason to believe that it does, unless
the extreme violence of the symptoms, and
the obstinacy of the vomiting, should by
some be reckoned proofs of such a state.
I certainly, however, am inclined to believe
that the last mentioned symptom proceeds
from inflammation and occlusion of the
pylorus, which Orfila describes as the effect
of poisoning by iodine.</p>

<p>It is a much more difficult task to dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>cover
a probable explanation of the manner
in which iodine disturbs the actions of the
nervous system. The rationale of diseases,
even when we are best acquainted with their
history, is obscure and unsatisfactory. Here
it is better at once to stop short, and confess
our ignorance, than, by adventurous speculation
and daring theory, lay a foundation
for mistakes in practice. This subject certainly
presents a fine field for hypothesis,
and a tempting one to a theorist. But we
leave our readers in possession of the facts,
and trust they will not use them with less
caution than ourselves. One thing only
seems probable, that is by its operation on
the brain, either immediately, or through the
agency of the nerves, that the effects we are
considering are produced. The similarity
of this effect of iodine to the mercurial
erethismus, so well described by Mr. Pearson,
will be evident to all, and is an analogy
deserving of attention and study. I have
seen many instances of gilders in Paris and
Geneva affected with mercurial erethismus,
closely resembling the erethismus from the
use of iodine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our most important consideration is the
cure of these painful affections. In the
choleric disease the first remedy of all, and
that without which we can have little hope
of subduing the disease, is opium. If called
early to the patient, before the bowels have yet
thrown off their acrid contents, I have generally
waited a little before exhibiting opium.
I have done this for two reasons: First, that
I might be certain of all acrid matters having
been removed from the alimentary canal
before the prescription of a medicine to
quiet its irritation; and, secondly, because
it is with great difficulty that the opium is
retained while the extreme irritation of the
disease is going forward. Emollient and
diluting injections will in these cases be
found most useful auxiliaries, both by washing
out the inferior portion of the gut, and
by quieting the violent action of the stomach.
Hemlock and hyoscyamus sometimes
succeed when opium fails. The case related
at page 7 was much relieved, indeed I may
say that the young lady’s life was saved, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
a quarter of a grain of acetate of morphium
given every half-hour. Every other form of
opium was tried without effect; they were
not even retained an instant on the stomach.
The acetate of morphium alone could be
taken, and it effectually restrained the disease,
which must otherwise have very soon
terminated the life of the patient. This
medicine has not, however, answered my
expectation in other cases. I have tried
various bitter and astringent medicines in
union with opium, but have found them uniformly
injurious during the first stage of
excitement and exacerbation. Afterwards,
when the disease has in some degree abated,
this class of medicine will be found useful.
I cannot too strongly caution my readers
against the use of purgatives in such cases.
However gentle they may be, their effect is
uniformly and most decidedly noxious. In
the first and acute period of this affection of
the alimentary canal, it is almost impossible
to quiet the disturbance which a purgative
occasions. A remedy which ought never
to be neglected is the warm bath. It will be
found a most powerful coadjutor in restrain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>ing
the violence of the spasms, and in moderating
the perturbed action of the stomach.</p>

<p>But the greatest difficulty will be found
in treating the second or chronic stage of the
complaint, when the symptoms we have
mentioned as characterising it are prolonged
in a mitigated form. I am inclined to
believe, that in this state there is actual
ulceration of the mucous membrane of the
intestines. I have only seen one case of this
kind, of which I have given the history
above. But several similar instances have
been communicated to me, and they must
be of frequent occurrence wherever iodine
is used ignorantly and rashly. In all those
cases of chronic affection of the alimentary
canal, with the particular history of which I
have been able to become acquainted, the
symptoms differed widely from those which
marked the accession of the disease. Instead
of the small vacillating pulse of the first
period of the complaint, it was bounding
and firm, the extremities were no longer
cold, nor the system collapsed; the diarrhœa
had assumed a dysenteric form, the
fæces being retained, and the dejections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
consisting chiefly of maturated mucus or
pus. In such cases, I believe, the conjoined
operation of aperient medicines and opium
will be found most advantageous in quieting
the symptoms. By this plan at least I succeeded
best in relieving the single case that
has yet occurred to me.</p>

<p>With regard to the treatment of the muscular
spasms, and the disturbance of the
nervous system, we have before described,
there is no invariable plan of cure to be followed.
Until we are better acquainted with
the nature of the affection, it is impossible to
apply a remedy to the root of the complaint.
All I can do here, therefore, is to point out
the means by which I have best succeeded
in averting and palliating its painful symptoms.
I have seen ten cases of this kind,
and all of them have seemed to be much
more benefited by attention to diet, air,
and exercise, than by any medicines they
have taken. Patients thus affected ought to
live much in the open air; their food should
be sparing, mild, and nutritious; and they
ought to avoid carefully the use of wine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
ardent spirits. By these means alone, and
the use of mild aperient medicines, two of
the cases alluded to were quickly recovered,
although they began in a very threatening
manner. All the others but one were much
relieved by the same means. I therefore
consider these simple remedies to be of the
greatest importance, and am convinced that
without them no other remedies will have
any effect. Next in importance to gentle
exercise in the open air, and attention to
diet, I should place the use of the warm
bath. By means of it the severity of the
spasms is very frequently relieved. The
young lady, whose case is related at <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>,
used it daily, sometimes several times in
a day, and never without benefit. She
could never enjoy any sleep at night unless
she had previously spent a quarter of an
hour in the bath; and to this day she continues
the use of it. Joined to the above
remedies, habitual attention must be paid to
the bowels. They should be moved by the
gentlest medicines, and they may often be
advantageously acted on by glisters only.
This manner of exhibiting medicine is fre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>quently
objected to in England, because it
only empties the lower parts of the larger
intestines; but repeated experience has
convinced me, that the mere circumstance of
evacuating the large intestines gives occasion
to, and stimulates the action of, the
higher passages. I do not intend to defend
the habitual abuse of enemata which is daily
witnessed on the Continent; but, in this
country, I think that their use may be extended
with advantage. In whatever way,
however, the bowels are evacuated, it is of
the greatest consequence that they should be
acted on by the gentlest medicines possible.
Such, however, is their slowness in this disease,
that it sometimes becomes necessary to
use the strongest medicine in order to effect
a mere evacuation; but I have never seen
the bowels violently moved without the
highest injury to the patient. My common
practice has been to prescribe small repeated
doses of one of the neutral salts, to each of
which I desire five or six drops of laudanum
to be added. By this means it has seemed
to me that my purpose was effected with least
violence. I have tried all the medicines of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the class of antispasmodics, and cannot speak
in favour of any one of them. They are
either useless or hurtful. The tinctures and
ethers are injurious in a very marked manner
and in a very high degree. Various
other remedies will, of course, be suggested
to the judicious practitioner by the peculiar
circumstances of each case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I may seem to some persons to have dwelt
too tediously on the poisonous properties of
iodine; but let it be recollected, by those
who have had opportunities of becoming
acquainted with its virtues, that this medicine
is as yet almost unknown to the numerous
practitioners who are now daily using it; that
it is a medicine of singular power and efficacy
in a great class of disorders, with which
the inhabitants of this country are peculiarly
afflicted; that this most useful remedy may
be divested of all its deleterious properties;
that, therefore, it will probably come into
general use among us; and they will allow
that I have not bestowed too much time on
this important subject. I wish the details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
had been more complete, that my experience
had been more extensive, and that I
had been better able to satisfy the reader’s
curiosity and my own.</p>

<p>Some of my readers, who have lately
been in the habit of using iodine cautiously,
and of watching its effects, may think that I
have overcharged the picture of its baneful
properties; but I have been an eyewitness
of all I have written; and I should extend
this treatise much beyond the limits I have
assigned to it, did I detail all the cases that
have reached me of the mischief it has produced.
I am glad, however, to add my testimony
to that of Coindet, de Carro, and
others, that this medicine may most certainly
be deprived of all its hurtful qualities, by
using it cautiously and watching its effect.
Like all other powerful medicines, when its
action is not controlled by the hand of a
master, its energies become a source of mischief
and ruin, instead of restoring the blessings
of health and strength; but when well
managed, it is a most useful remedy, and a
valuable addition to our materia medica. I
have used it myself in a great number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
cases, and I have never yet, in my own practice,
had occasion to regret the occurrence
of any of the violent symptoms I have described.
I have more than once discontinued
the medicine on finding the pulse become
frequent, small, and depressed, on account
of watchfulness, flying pains of the
joints, tremors, or pain at the stomach; but
having early detected these symptoms, they
were not allowed to become formidable.
Dr. Coindet states, that he has prescribed the
medicine to one hundred and fifty patients,
and that he has never had occasion to observe
any mischief from its use.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Dr. Decarro
has given it at Vienna to one hundred
and twenty patients; Dr. Erlinger, of Zurich,
to seventy; and Dr. Formey has prescribed
it extensively, in Prussia, with the
same favourable results. Dr. Decarro, in
his enthusiasm about this new medicine,
seems almost to doubt whether accidents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>have ever occurred from its use, though
these accidents have been as public as the
day, and the unhappy patients have paid
with their lives the inexperience and rashness
of their physicians. Thus far I can
agree with Decarro, that I have never known
or heard of any bad effect from iodine, when
it had not been used unadvisedly and injudiciously.
It has been used extensively by
Hufeland in Germany, who makes no mention
of its deleterious properties; and a great
number of physicians in London and Paris,
and various parts of England and France,
have also lately employed it. They have
either not met with the accidents I have
described, or have prudently concealed
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having now considered the effects of
iodine on the alimentary canal and the
nervous system, we are prepared for studying
its effect on the absorbent vessels, by
which its use in medicine is indicated.
This is the most important subject which
has yet fallen under my review, and I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
give it as much extension as may be
necessary for its perfect discussion. It has
been already seen at <a href="#Page_10">pages 10</a> and <a href="#Page_12">12</a> that
the lymphatic system is very powerfully and
generally stimulated, so as to occasion a
great absorption of all the sebaceous, muscular,
and glandular structures of the body;
but it will be seen, in the following pages,
that the action of iodine may be directed
exclusively against tumors, and local disorders,
while the healthy structures of the
body remain unaffected.</p>

<p>The absorbent system is distributed over
every part of the body. In the brain alone
the vessels of this class have not, hitherto, been
detected and submitted to ocular demonstration
by any other anatomist than Mascagni.
But physiological and pathological proofs
of their existence, equal in force to any
anatomical evidence, are not wanting to
demonstrate their presence in the central
organ of the nervous system. The office
which these vessels discharge, in the nutrition
of the body and removal of its waste, is
most important to its healthy condition; and
the influence it exerts, in a state of disease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
is not less considerable. From the inactivity
or obstruction of the absorbent vessels,
a great proportion of the chronic disorders
of the body take their rise. Medicines,
therefore, which act either directly or indirectly
on this system, have always been
accounted most valuable articles of the
materia medica. Unhappily, they too
often deceive us in their operation, and,
notwithstanding the united studies of many
physicians directed to them, the causes of
their failure, as well as the circumstances
under which they succeed, still remain a
problem. A considerable step towards the
solution of this difficulty has, indeed, been
lately taken by Dr. Blackall. Much
obscurity, however, yet rests upon the
subject, and a direct medical agent on the
absorbent system, whose effects are speedy,
indubitable, and powerful, is a great desideratum
in the art of healing.</p>

<p>Such an agent is iodine. Its effects on
the absorbent system are incontrovertible.
They are as speedy as they are certain, and
so powerful are they, that if the medicine
be not duly and cautiously managed, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
have already seen what havoc may be the
result. A few, a very few, cases have
occurred to myself, in which the constitution
was altogether insensible to its action; I believe
a greater number have occurred to
others; but I cannot help thinking that such
cases have been owing, in many instances,
either to some fault in the medicine, or to
some inadvertence on the part of the practitioner.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>We shall first consider the use of iodine
in the treatment of bronchocele, the disease
for the cure of which it was introduced into
practice. All the physicians who have
employed it bear unequivocal testimony to
its efficacy. It seldom fails of effecting a
complete cure, and when it does, it almost
always reduces the swelling very considerably.
The promptitude of its action is at
times very extraordinary. Decarro states,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
that one of his patients, thirty-eight years of
age, after taking the remedy for seventeen
days, had the circumference of his neck
reduced from one foot seven inches and a
half, to one foot three inches and three-quarters.
Dr. Coindet relates a case of a
man, fifty years of age, in which this
medicine, taken internally, reduced a very
large goître considerably in size, after six
days’ treatment only. An old woman, aged
sixty-five, who took this medicine under my
care for a goître, with which she had been
affected nearly forty years, had the circumference
of her neck reduced from twenty-two
inches to eighteen, on the twenty-fifth day.
Such rapid diminution in the size of the
tumor is not to be always expected. In
some cases a whole month, and even more,
elapses before any effect is visible. In
general, however, the powers of the medicine
are manifest at the end of the second
week and considerable progress towards
cure has been made at the end of a month.
I have endeavoured to find out whether
there was any thing in the constitution of
the different persons under my own observa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>tion,
or in their state of health, which
rendered them more or less apt to be
affected by this medicine. I have not
been very successful in this inquiry. But
I found that in two cases of women afflicted
with extensive and very painful varix of the
veins of all the extremities, the effect of
iodine was produced with great difficulty.
This fact seemed to coincide with the result
of Mr. Magendie’s very interesting experiments
on absorption, and I accordingly
desired one of the persons, to whom I have
just alluded, to lose a little blood from the arm.
The effect of the medicine was very much
accelerated by this treatment, but a consequence
I did not look for was also the result
of it, viz. the total and sudden disappearance
of the varix, which had commenced during
uterine gestation twelve years before.
The goître succeeded the varix after her
delivery. I merely mention the facts of
this case, which may suggest useful hints
to those who may meet with a case similarly
circumstanced. Since its occurrence, whenever
the medicine is slow in its operation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
provided the vessels be full and plethoric,
I desire a little blood to be taken away from
the arm, and I almost invariably find the
action of the medicine much quickened. I
have sometimes, also, thought that the cases,
in which blood was taken away, were cured
more easily and with less suffering than the
others.</p>

<p>There is, very rarely, any considerable
effect produced on the arterial system by
iodine, if it be given with propriety and caution.
Sometimes it accelerates the pulse in a
slight degree; it frequently occasions a little
mucous expectoration from the chest, and it
often raises nervous symptoms in delicate
subjects, which are very distressing. I saw
it given to a young woman in one of the
public hospitals in Paris, in whom it
produced such a state of insomnia that she
told me she had not slept at all for a whole
week, though she had been a very good
sleeper before. I have said that it affects
the pulse but a little, yet it sometimes
stimulates very powerfully the arterial
vessels of the tumor. This is mentioned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
all the authors who have written on iodine,
and is one of the most singular circumstances
in its medical history!</p>

<p>This irritation of arterial vessels frequently
becomes active inflammation, requiring
the use of bloodletting for its relief.
Topical bleeding will, in general, be found
fully competent to remove it. Indeed, it
sometimes happens that when the iodine has
lighted up smart inflammation in the tumor,
the arterial system generally is unaffected.
To what is this effect on the vessels of the
part to be attributed, from which the constitution
generally is free?</p>

<p>The same is occasionally true of the
absorbent vessels. I have seen some very
large tumors discussed, while there was no
evidence whatever of the absorbent vessels
in other parts of the body having felt the
influence of the medicine. It is a curious
question, to determine by what law the
constitution remains impassive to the action
of a medicine, which affects remote and
distant parts through the constitution. Certain
tumors are of so irritable a nature,
that a stimulus, which only serves to rouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the healthy energies of the body, excites the
process of destruction in them. In the
quaint language of a celebrated modern
lecturer, “they are irritable beings, if you
touch them they’ll kick.” But this is not
the case with many of the tumors which are
dissipated by iodine. Bronchocele, for
instance, is of a slow growth; all the
operations which go forward in its structure
are of a very indolent and chronic kind.
Such, also, is the case with the greater
number of scrophulous tumors. Yet all of
them have been dissipated, like a charm, by
the agency of iodine.</p>

<p>In prescribing this medicine, it is very
necessary not to lose sight of the effect I
have just mentioned. When the tumor is
very large, and especially in that kind of
bronchocele, in which the principal enlargement
of the thyroid gland takes place on its
inner surface, where it is in contact with the
trachea, the occurrence of inflammation is
much to be apprehended. When a very
large tumor becomes inflamed, the distress
which it occasions, and the disturbance it
excites in the constitution, are very consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>able;
and in the second case to which I have
alluded, inflammation of the trachea is very
readily excited.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Such cases are easily
distinguished by the immovability of the
tumor, and the effect they have in altering
the voice. On dissection, the trachea is
sometimes found to have been very much
compressed by them.</p>

<p>It is now fit that I should mention the
most common and beneficial methods of
using this substance. Dr. Coindet has
recommended the hydriodate of potass as an
external application, and my experience has
certainly confirmed his choice. The hydriodate
of soda, however, will be found to
answer equally well. Practitioners may
choose between these two remedies. I have
used the iodates, but I have found them at
once more inert and more unmanageable.
They possess all the virtues of iodine in a
very remarkable degree, but they will be
found to fail more frequently than the
hydriodatic salts; and, if I may draw any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
conclusion from the few trials I have given
them, they are more apt to excite disorder in
the system. I have generally ordered half a
dram of the hydriodate of potass to be
united to an ounce and a half of axunge,
and desired the patient to rub in a dram of
this ointment over the surface of the tumor,
night and morning. When the tumor is
painful, it is not necessary to rub in.
The ointment may be used in the manner
recommended by Scattigna.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> All that is
necessary is to choose a portion of the
surface of the body where the skin is very
tender and thin, and simply to apply the
ointment over night. For this purpose,
almost any part of the body which is habitually
covered may be chosen; but in the
axilla, and in the inner surface of the thighs
close to the scrotum, the absorption will be
found most rapid.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>It is a more important question to
determine the proper method of using this
medicine internally. From my own experience,
I am inclined to give a decided
preference to the solution over the tincture.
It is prepared by dissolving thirty grains of
the hydriodate <i>of potass</i> in an ounce of
distilled water. I have generally begun this
preparation by a dose of ten drops, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
augmented it gradually to twenty, and, very
seldom, to twenty-five. This preparation
can dissolve an additional dose of iodine; a
formulary, however, to which I seldom, if
ever, have recourse. I have found that the
deleterious action of the medicine on the
bowels was more marked, in proportion to
the quantity of free iodine it contained.
For this reason, also, I now seldom have
recourse to the tincture, a form much used,
because it is less expensive. Practitioners
will, in general, find an advantage in confining
themselves to the external use of iodine for
the cure of bronchocele, and tumors, which
do not arise from any vice in the constitution.
In a few cases of bronchocele, however,
it is necessary to have recourse to its internal
use, especially when the disease exists
in a strumous habit. By the use, either of
the ointment, or of the solution in the way we
have recommended, a soft bronchocele will
be discussed in a month or six weeks.
Those which are hard, and of old growth,
generally take a little longer time, and many
of these latter cases cannot be altogether
reduced. I have seen two cases, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
in which the tumors gradually disappeared
some weeks after the medicine had been
altogether discontinued. Dr. Coindet says,
that he has seen several cases of bronchocele,
complicated with watery cysts, yield completely
to the action of iodine. I have only
had occasion to see one such case treated
by this medicine. It was somewhat lessened
in its bulk, and the patient was certainly
relieved, but the disease was by no means
cured.</p>

<p>If the iodine be given internally, it is
indispensably necessary to watch its effects
from day to day. No peculiarity of circumstances
whatever can dispense the physician
from this care; and if it be recollected
that it is yet a new medicine, that unknown
accidents, to which it is liable, may be
discovered by future investigations, this
caution will not appear superfluous. The
case related by Dr. Coindet, to which we
have already alluded at <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>, in which
a very powerful and painful effect was produced
at the end of the fifth day, sufficiently
evinces the necessity of the watchfulness
here recommended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>When iodine acts kindly on the constitution,
no other effect will be found to
accompany its use, but a diminution of the
tumor and a little nervous excitement, which
is sometimes not so severe as to become
disagreeable. The increase of appetite is
a very frequent effect of iodine, and it is
sometimes very troublesome, because it is
extremely necessary not to indulge it. The
diet of the patient should be good, but by no
means full, which the occasional voraciousness
of his appetite would lead him to adopt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having established that the use of iodine
in bronchocele was owing to its effect on the
absorbent system, it was natural to conclude
that it would be of equal service in the cure
of scrophula.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Accordingly, we find that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Dr. Coindet made trial of it in the cure of
the latter disease, soon after he had determined
its virtues in the former, and that his
experiment was followed by the most satisfactory
result. I have already considered
at so great length the general effects of
iodine on the constitution, that little remains
for me in this place but to mention the
particular cases in which I have found it
useful, and those in which it has failed my
expectations.</p>

<p>The first case of scrophula in which I
made use of this medicine, was that of a
young lady eighteen years of age, who had
been affected by glandular swellings of the
neck for nearly eight years. She used the
solution of hydriodate of potass for a month;
the dose varied from ten to twenty drops
three times a day, with occasional intermission
of a day when the absorption was
going on rapidly. At the end of this time
she had got perfectly rid of her swellings,
and she now (two years since she took the
medicine) remains perfectly well. When
she discontinued her drops, so far from
having been incommoded by them, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
health was certainly much improved. There
remained several little fistulous sores, which
required the assistance of the knife to heal
them. The iodine is not equally efficacious
in all cases of this kind. Great numbers,
however, yield rapidly under its use; but
many of them, also, resist its operation. I
have never been able to assign even a plausible
reason for this difference of its action in
scrophula. In general, I have found such
cases yield more readily to the internal than
to the external use of iodine. The scrophulous
glands of children are not so easily affected by
iodine as those of persons who have attained
the age of puberty, and they are also more
liable to a relapse.</p>

<p>A female servant in one of the public
hotels of Paris, aged thirty-three, married,
who had born several children, shewed me
a tumor of her right breast she had had
about two years. It was not attended with
any pain, but had lately somewhat increased,
which gave her alarm. About a year before
she had been advised by a surgeon to have it
cut out. This advice gave her so much
uneasiness, that she presented herself at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
clinical consultations of M. Dubois. That
eminent surgeon immediately distinguished
the tumor to be scrophulous; and during
three months’ treatment, all the usual remedies
of this disease were exhausted without the
least effect. A scruple of the ointment of
the hydriodate of potass, placed in the axilla
at night, completely removed the tumor in
about six weeks. This is the only case of a
similar kind in which I have used iodine.
I have never yet employed it in scirrhus of
the breast.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>I was called in the month of February,
1822, to visit a boy five years old, affected
in the following manner. Since the period
of his birth, he had always been weakly, but,
for the last two years, had gradually been
falling off in his flesh and strength. He
complained of frequent pains in his bowels,
which were alternately confined and purged;
the motions were discoloured and scybalous;
he frequently vomited his food; his abdomen
was much swelled; the rest of his body considerably
emaciated; pulse natural; appetite
variable, but never great. It was impossible
to doubt, from the appearance of the child,
that the mesenteric glands were enlarged, and
I determined to make a very cautious trial of
iodine. It was the first case in which I had
used it for an internal disease, and I therefore
watched it with unremitting care. I began by
giving my little patient twelve drops in the
day, which I gradually augmented to twenty,
and I had the pleasure of seeing the abdomen
gradually diminish in size, the bowels
become more regular, the evacuations restored
to their natural colour, the pain
diminish and vanish, the appetite increase,
and at the end of five weeks the child return
to comparative health, without the occurrence
of a single untoward symptom. The
only medicine I employed during this treatment,
besides iodine, was occasionally a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
grains of rhubarb. At the end of the five
weeks the bowels acted without medicine.
I am sorry to say that I lost sight of this
child from this time. The parents were
poor, were probably satisfied with the benefit
they had received, and not willing to incur
any farther expense for medicine. I have
since prescribed this medicine in two other
cases of disease of the mesenteric glands.
The result was not so satisfactory as in the
case I have just related, but both of them
were considerably relieved, and had they
been more attentive to the directions given
them, I have little doubt that they also would
have obtained a complete cure. But they
were in the poorest class of society, were irregular
in their habits, and paid very imperfect
attention to the orders of their physician.
In one of them, a young woman, fifteen
years old, after she had taken fifteen drops
of the solution of hydriodate of potass, twice
a-day during three weeks, considerable
tenderness of the whole abdomen came on,
for which I judged it necessary to order the
application of a dozen leeches. The relief
was immediate. From the whole appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>ance
of the case, I judged this feverish
attack to be an affection of the mesenteric
glands, similar to what I have described at
<a href="#Page_39">p. 39.</a></p>

<p>I have used this medicine in cases where
I had good evidence of the presence of
tubercles in the lungs, and I do not doubt
that it will be found to be serviceable in the
incipient stages of the disease. But I much
question whether it will prove even innocent
in the more advanced periods of tubercles,
when extensive disorganization has taken
place in the lungs. Some cases in which I
have prescribed it, were benefitted in so
marked a manner as to have inspired me
with hopes of having at length found a
remedy for that hitherto intractable and
cruel malady. Other cases, on the contrary,
seemed to be much aggravated by its use.
If I may judge from the cautious expressions
of Dr. Baron, in his work on tuberculous
disease, this is nearly the result of his experience
also. It is much to be desired that
we had sufficient data for distinguishing the
cases in which its use is beneficial, inert, and
injurious. As yet, the results I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
obtained do not entitle me to come to any
very definite conclusion on this subject.
Mr. Haden, in his translation of Magendie’s
Pharmacopœia, has given the history of a
case of affection of the chest, in which he
seems evidently to think that tubercles were
removed by the agency of iodine. I am
glad to find this case stated by Mr. Haden
with his characteristic candour and caution.
It is much to be desired that a series of such
cases were published. They would form the
materials on which a just estimate of the
powers of this medicine might be formed. I
trust to be able, at no distant period, to give
the result of my experience in this disease
to the public, in such a manner as to establish
what are the real virtues of iodine
in the cure of pulmonary tubercles. At
present, there is certainly sufficient ground
for making a cautious trial of its powers;
but, if I may trust to my own experience, it
is impossible to use it with too much circumspection.</p>

<p>A young gentleman, aged twenty-six,
who had passed four winters in the south of
Europe for a cough, with pain in his chest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and occasional expectoration of a thick
maturated discharge, frequently streaked
with blood, consulted me on account of
swelled glands in his neck, which he had
had from his infancy, but which were at that
time particularly troublesome. I desired
him to use a solution of hydriodate of potass
in the dose, of twelve drops three times
a-day. In the course of two months, the
swellings in the neck, which had pained him
from his infancy, were quite dispersed, and
at the same time his sufferings in the chest
were so much diminished that he requested
to be allowed to continue the medicine. I
allowed him to use it a fortnight longer, at
the end of which time he was quite free
from complaint. He subsequently had
another attack of his chest complaint, and
wrote to me from Thoulouse to request
directions for renewing the use of the medicine,
under the care of a French physician.
Before my letter reached him, he was
carried off by an attack of some violent
complaint, of which I never could learn the
history. I have exhibited this medicine in
several such cases, and frequently with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
most marked good effects. In fine, I have
not the smallest doubt of its efficacy in
relieving many diseases of the chest, in
which all the general symptoms, as well as
all the local means of exploring the condition
of the lungs, which have lately been so
much attended to in France, have given me
the most satisfactory evidence of the presence
of tubercles. I will not yet assert,
however, that the use of iodine has been
followed by the absorption of tubercles in
the lungs. This important fact must not be
affirmed hastily; but I trust I shall be enabled,
at a future period, to establish it to
the satisfaction of every one, or to explain
the beneficial action of the medicine on other
grounds.</p>

<p>Dr. Baron, in his work already quoted
(p. 221), has related a case of encysted
dropsy of the ovarium, in which the use
of iodine was attended with the most manifest
and rapid benefit. I have seen it
used in a case of the same kind, in which a
swelling that had been twice tapped, and
which then filled the greater part of the
abdomen, was almost completely removed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
The patient, a woman of sixty-two, has recovered
her strength; she has resumed the
appearance of health, and has remained
eighteen months free from dropsical symptoms.</p>

<p>I have made trial of iodine in two cases
of ascites without benefit. I have also made
use of it in a case of amenorrhœa, according
to Coindet’s advice, without the smallest advantage;
nor have I been able to satisfy
myself that it possesses any power over the
uterine system.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>


<p>The liability of iodine to excite great
disturbance in the constitution, has been
made an objection to its use. I fear that this
reproach must be shared by all powerful
medicines whatever. If unattended to, or
used with levity, any medicine which is
capable of doing good, may also do harm.
But if used with due discretion and properly
watched, I have no hesitation in affirming,
that iodine may be employed with as much
safety as any of the powerful remedies which
are daily in the hands of the least skilful
members of the profession. But it has been
also made a subject of reproach to this
remedy that it is quite inert and useless.
I shall not give any further reply to such
a statement than what the foregoing pages
contain. But I am credibly informed that
it has been used by several eminent prac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>titioners
of London; who finding it quite
inert, had laid it aside as useless<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out one source of
such mistakes (<a href="#Page_3">page 3</a>). I fear, however,
that it has also been used by physicians who
have not leisure of mind nor time enough
for conducting such inquiries as they ought
to be conducted. When we consider the
silly pretences on which medicines are sometimes
forced into fashionable practice, it
will not appear wonderful that the investigation
of their virtues should not be conducted
with much zeal. But I know also
that it has been hastily rejected, and without
trial, by some persons grown old in the
practice of physic, who have made their
interests decidedly to consist in defending
all that is old, and repudiating all that is new.
Such persons expose themselves to ridicule
when we see them reject a remedy so active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
as iodine, and continue to trust, for the cure
of the severest diseases to which the human
frame is liable, to medicines allowed on all
hands, and even by themselves, to be absolutely
useless.</p>

<p>The value of iodine as a remedy, however,
does not depend on the testimony of
any individual, however high his name. Its
use is established by a long series of facts
observed by physicians and surgeons of different
countries. Wherever it has received
a fair trial from unprejudiced persons, its
effects have been so striking and undeniable
as to force assent. It is not one of those
remedies which is adopted by one man, and
rejected by another, according to the accident
or caprice of the moment; but one
whose effects are written in such clear and
intelligible characters, that <i>he that runs can
read</i>. Its applications also are in cases of
such common occurrence, that all practitioners
have an opportunity of satisfying
themselves of the real nature of the remedy,
and the extent of its powers.</p>

<p>This medicine has also been called an
empirical remedy. Of what importance is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
it that it should bear this or any other name,
by which the enemies of every thing that is
new endeavour to keep others in the same
state of happy ignorance which satisfies their
own indolence, and answers the demands of
the common routine of their practice? But
in what respect is it an empirical remedy?
Do we know any thing more of the action of
a purgative? It is said to stimulate the
larger or the smaller intestines, and iodine
may be said to stimulate the absorbent vessels;
and after we have said this, are we at
all wiser than we were before? The only
questions now before us, those which alone
appear worthy of discussion, are, Do we in
iodine possess a remedy for the diseases in
which I have said it is useful? and if we do,
on which of the living textures does it seem
most particularly to exert its action? These
questions settled, all the rest is of comparatively
trivial importance.</p>

<p>The medicines which exert their action
on particular textures or systems are extremely
few indeed, and the few we possess
are so uncertain in their operations, they are
liable to such frequent failures, that sceptical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
physicians doubt of their efficacy altogether,
and even of the efficiency of medicine.
There is something peculiarly gratifying to
their vanity in supposing themselves freed
from the common errors, and above the credulity
of the vulgar. Iodine, however, is
not liable to the sneers of such narrow
minds. It is a real “heroic remedy”—a
true present from the science of medicine to
mankind.</p>

<p>I have here thrown into an Appendix a
brief account of the different preparations
of which I have had occasion to make mention.
It is chiefly extracted from Magendie’s
Formulary, which will be found to
contain sufficient directions for the chemical
and pharmaceutical operations undergone
by iodine.</p>

<p>
Take of Alcohol, of sp. gr. of .842, 1 oz.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Iodine, 39 gr.</span><br />
Dissolve.
</p></div>

<p>This preparation should not be long
kept, as it readily undergoes alteration and
decomposition. Alcohol varies in its solvent
power of iodine according to its degree of
concentration. The frequent opening of
the vessels, therefore, in which it is kept,
must occasion a change in the quality of
the tincture, by allowing the evaporation
of the spirit, and thus occasioning a diffu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>sion
of undissolved iodine through this preparation.
Mr. Magendie seems also to fear,
that a decomposition of the alcohol may take
place from the superior affinity of iodine
for hydrogen. Altogether this is certainly
the most objectionable form in which iodine
is used.</p>

<p>I have generally prescribed these two
preparations in cinnamon or mint water, in
which form they are seldom disagreeable to
the stomach. I have avoided, as much as
possible, joining them to any tinctures or
infusions, as we are yet in a great degree
unacquainted with the chemical habits of
iodine and the different vegetable substances.
It will be sometimes, however,
found advisable to use tonics with iodine.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The total inefficacy of this medicine in the hands of
British Practitioners, while its virtues are so palpable
and evident at Geneva, that not only Physicians, but also
the inhabitants in general, are convinced of their reality,
had always surprised me. I was at a loss to account for
testimony so contradictory. It seemed as if medicine
were a science so uncertain and futile, that its plainest
facts depend more on the authority of name than on the
substantial evidence of observation and experiment. I
lately obtained an explanation of this difficulty from a
quarter in which I can place implicit reliance. It seems
that the chemists are much in the habit of substituting
charcoal for burnt sponge, of which an undeniable proof
is the fact, that burnt sponge is sold at an inferior rate to
the same article before it has undergone the process of
combustion.—I may also be allowed to state in this place,
that I have sent prescriptions for the hydriodate of potass
to several chemists in London—that my prescriptions were
said to have been made up; but that a few days afterwards,
when I called at their shops, in order to examine
the medicine, I discovered that they were not even aware
of the existence of such a drug. If such frauds continue
to be committed with impunity, the sick had better submit
patiently to their pains, than have recourse to physicians,
whose science is rendered unavailing for the profit
of tradesmen.</p>

any power over the absorbent system.</p>

from much of the inconvenience occasioned by rubbing.
I have seen several persons use it in this manner with ease,
who could not rub in mercury without much suffering.
Scattigna asserts that it is also much more efficacious than
when rubbed in by the common method. His way of
using it is, to extend a scruple of mercurial ointment over
the skin of the axilla before the patient goes to sleep.
In the morning, the whole of it will be found to be
absorbed, and in this way he calculates that as strong an
effect is produced as by a drachm of the ointment. I have
used, in a case of hydrothorax, an ointment of squills in
the same way, which has caused an increased flow of
urine, which I had vainly endeavoured to effect by
means of the same medicine given by the mouth. These
statements are at variance with the experience of Mr.
Pearson, which must be allowed to be of much weight in

that a little boy from one of the interior towns of
Switzerland, was brought to him on account of a swelling
of the knee-joint. He had already been under the care of
several eminent surgeons, who had all declared the tumor
to be a white swelling, and had recommended the amputation
of the limb. Such, also, was the opinion of Mr.
Maunoir; but finding the friends and the boy himself

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
